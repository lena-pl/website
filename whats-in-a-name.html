  <h3>Why did you change your name?</h3>
  <p>The crew previously behind Rails Girls Wellington events is excited to bring you our newest workshops as part of the RailsBridge learning community. </p>

  <p>The decision to transfer brands was made as part of our ongoing commitment to inclusivity in tech. This workshop has always aimed to bring tech to folks who are underrepresented in the field. This includes girls and women, but it also extends to non-binary and gender nonconforming people, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, people of colour, people with disabilities, and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>

  <p>We love and appreciate our background, and the support we have received from the international Rails Girls community. This transition is a response to seeing the diverse range of applicants we have had for the Rails Girls workshops over the years and recognising that our community stretches far beyond women and girls.</p>

  <p>The crew felt that the RailsBridge philosophy reflected our goals and on-going priorities accurately. A few words from the international RailsBridge crew:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“We teach people to code because we believe that the people making technology should accurately reflect the diversity of those using it.</p>
    <p>We want to push for all kinds of diversity in tech: gender, race, sexual orientation, ability, and class. Women were the first population we focused on, but aren't the last.</p>
    <p>We value acceptance, enthusiasm, and hard work. The RailsBridge community thrives on optimism and a love for making great things.”</p> - railsbridge.org/about
  </blockquote>

  <p>Rest assured, the crew remains the same, the content will keep evolving based on your feedback from previous Rails Girls Wellington events, and the workshops remain and always will be 100% FREE. Thank you for being part of this community!</p>
